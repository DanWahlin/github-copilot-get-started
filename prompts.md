# Prompts Used to Create the Website

[ Started with Opus 4.5 LLM]

I'd like to create a website called “WeatherView” that's super professional looking. It would pull weather data from the open-meteo.com API and render cards for the next 5 days of weather. Create a plan to make this website a reality, determine a good API to call, the design used, and optimizations needed to make it a great website!

I'd like to have some Playwright tests available to test that cities such as Seattle, Phoenix, and New York City render properly. Can you create those tests for me, add the appropriate packages, etc.?

Can you make it save screenshots as it checks for the cities I listed? Save them to tests/screenshots

[Select the Generate Instructions Option]

Move the content into AGENTS.md in the root.

Update AGENTS.md to follow the standard format for that file. Research it on the internet if needed.

Do deep analysis on the CSS and ensure that it's optimized. Remove any classes or styles not being used.

## Bonus (not included in current repo)

Switch to Gemini 3 Pro and run:

Can you analyze the current look and feel of this website. What improvements can we make to it to make it a super engaging and eye catching site that people love to visit?
